<h1>The Best Movies According to Janella</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Boy in Striped Pajamas</h3>
    <p>This is one of the best movies I have seen where there is innocence yet a sense of depth and it tackles history.</p>

<h3>Get Out</h3>
    <p>Well I cannot think of any so I'm recommending this one. But it's a good movie pointing to black community against white supremacy. </p>
<h3>Interceptor</h3>
    <p>This is one of underrated movies out there. It's a good action movie for me.</p>
